### <a name="summary">Summary</a>

Currently completing the intensive 12 weeks of [Makers Academy](https://github.com/makersacademy)

I am a responsible, hard working and enthusiastic person. Being worked in different projects and environments helped me to adopt the changes quickly.

I am passionate about learning new technologies, bringing ideas to life and working with dedicated teams to build efficient and robust appplications suited to the user's needs. 

I am currently looking to change carrer from teaching into software developer, where I can further expand my knowledge in Full-Stack and Front-End development and design.
