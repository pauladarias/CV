### <a name="summary">Hi there!</a>


Iâ€™m Paula and Iâ€™m very excited to find my first role as Junior Front-End Developer. After finishing Makers Iâ€™ve been working on my own projects, learning React and optimising my website. 

Iâ€™ve been a teacher for the past 8 years, that have helped me to focus on my learning process and to believe that with perseverance, commitment and passion anything can be learnt. 

I love web design and I enjoy building intuitive websites, thanks to my arts background, creative thinking and attention to detail Iâ€™m able to create easy and good looking applications. 

I am an enthusiastic, responsible and hard working person. I've worked in different projects and environments throughout my career helping me to adapt to the changes quickly.

### <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- **Good communicator** - Skilled in communicating effectively with strong interpersonal and organizational skills.
- **Adaptable** - New environments, new languages, new teams, new challenges. None of these are problems, only opportunities. I have worked in a few countries around the world with a huge diversity of teams. There is always a way to connect.
- **Attention to detail** - In my previous experience as an educator, I have developed an extremely keen eye for the fine details. This comes through in the way I write code, from seeing how the whole code fits in together.
- **Enthusiastic** - I am highly motivated and unafraid of challenges, that's what keeps me motivated every day to keep up working on new projects.
- **Commitment** - I completed the 3 months of Makers Academy coding bootcamp as a remote student. This required discipline and focus â€“ with a considerable helping of self-belief.
- **Diligent** - Excellent ethics, hardworking, focus minded and sound organizational ability.
- **Collaborator** - A friendly, passionate and confident communicator. Able to build lasting relationships with people.

Currently working on different Front End projects
